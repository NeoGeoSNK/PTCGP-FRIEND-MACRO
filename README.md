# A friend macro for Pok√©mon TCG Pocket game by nyu

The code was heavily based on the open-source macro "PtcgP-FriendMacro-GaloXDoido" created by [GaloXDoido](https://github.com/GaloXDoido/PtcgP-FriendMacro-GaloXDoido). & "Banana Macro PtcgP," created by [banana-juseyo](https://github.com/banana-juseyo/Banana-Macro-PtcgP).

**__How can I get it working?__**

The steps to use this macro are basically the same as [Arturo's Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket Bot](https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB), so I will take the liberty of reproducing the same steps here, with some relevant modifications.

__ATTENTION!!__

This script __REQUIRES AutoHotKey v2.0__. If you're using Arthuro's bot, you MUST install the updated AutoHotKey 2.0 version to use this script.

Don't worry ‚Äî Arthuro's bot will continue to work, as AutoHotKey supports having multiple versions installed simultaneously on Windows.

If you try to run this script with an older AHK version, __it won't open at all__.

#

Step 1: Install the necessary programs
- [AutoHotKey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe) (It needs to be version 2.0. The macro will not run if you are using earlier versions of AHK.)

# FAQ

__Q: Can it be used with multiple instances?__

A: It hasn't been officially tested, but it is possible to copy multiple folders and run them. Some users have reported minor issues, but overall it works well.

__Q: "Error while update" appears when starting the macro.__

A: This can happen due to issues during the automatic update process. Re-download the macro file and try again.
