# PtcgP FriendMacro by GaloXDoido
A open source Macro WITH GUI to automatically add and remove friends in the Pokémon TCG Pocket game, made with AutoHotKey.
The code was heavily based on the open-source macro "Banana Macro PtcgP," created by banana-juseyo.
I completely adapted the logic of the original Korean code to remove certain restrictions related to exclusive use by specific users and added localization for English, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese, along with a few other modifications.
이 코드는 banana-juseyo가 작성한 원본 코드를 기반으로 했습니다. 감사합니다!
