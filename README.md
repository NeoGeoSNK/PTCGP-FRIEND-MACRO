# A friend macro for Pok√©mon TCG Pocket game by nyu

The code was heavily based on the open-source macro "PtcgP-FriendMacro-GaloXDoido" created by [GaloXDoido](https://github.com/GaloXDoido/PtcgP-FriendMacro-GaloXDoido). & "Banana Macro PtcgP," created by [banana-juseyo](https://github.com/banana-juseyo/Banana-Macro-PtcgP).

#
__ATTENTION!!__

- The maximum pending friend request is 30, limited by the game itself.

#
**__How can I get it working?__**

Step 1: Install the necessary programs
- [AutoHotKey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe) (It needs to be version 2.0. The macro will not run if you are using earlier versions of AHK.)
- [Global MuMu Player](https://adl.easebar.com/d/g/mumu/c/mumuglobal?type=pc&direct=1)
- [tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/download/5.5.0/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.5.0.20241111.exe) (Depended by delete friend feature)
  You need add the tesseract-ocr install location to the **Path** Environment Variables of your system (e.g. C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR).

Step 2: Set-Up MuMu Player

  - **Custom: 540 x 960 220 dpi**
  - **Screen brightness: 50**
  - **Screen style: Common**
  - FPS: 60
